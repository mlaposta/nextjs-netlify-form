This is a basic [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that was bootstrapped with `yarn create next-app`.

The `pages/index.js` file has been modified to contain a simple Contact form, that will utilize Netlify's built-in form handling capabilities. The form will not work on it's own without the Netlify build process. Refer to `pages/index.js` for the code, and [wheresbaldo.dev](https://wheresbaldo.dev/posts/2023/August/Build-a-Simple-Contact-Form-with-Next-JS-and-Netlify) for the instructions and tutorial.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the contact form.

You can edit the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
